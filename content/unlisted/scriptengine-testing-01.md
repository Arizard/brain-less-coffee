# Welcome Tester!

I'm developing **ScriptEngine** (working title) - a web app to help instructors format and organise their scripts. It's currently in the early development stages and is [live here](http://react.less.coffee).

## The Benefits

1.  Get started straight away
2.  Never lose your script data (cloud based)
3.  Access on any device
4.  Keep script formatting consistent
5.  Easily print to PDF or paper

## Quick Start Guide

1.  [Create an account](http://react.less.coffee) by entering an email address and a password at the login panel. 

    **Note that at this stage, the site is insecure - please use a _fake password_**. 

    Click **Sign Up** and the app will take you to your documents.

2.  Click **New Document**. The app will take you to the document editor.

3.  Click or tap on any text field to edit.
    -   Editing the title will edit the document name in the document browser.

4.  The three row types:
    1.  Header - this can be used for track titles.
    2.  Script row - this has four fields: `Counts`, `Move Name`, `Move Outcome`, `Relevant Cues`.
    3.  Paragraph - this is a plain text field which can be used for adding class and track focus/objective, or generic notes.
    
5.  Confirm you can add new rows:
    -   Click or tap this button at the bottom of the document ![screenshot](https://storage.googleapis.com/arie-images/screenshots/2019-09-09_01-13-56.png)
    -   Click or tap the **ellipsis** next to each row for more options: ![screenshot](https://storage.googleapis.com/arie-images/screenshots/2019-09-09_01-15-11.png)

## Feedback

I'd love to get some honest feedback on the product and the user experience. It would be extremely valuable to the development process and to my personal growth as a software developer. Your feedback will influence the decision to continue developing the product or to go back to the drawing board.

These are the advantages over other media that I'm aiming for:

-   Intuitive to use for non-technical and new users
-   Faster to create, read and modify scripts
-   More convenient to keep track of scripts (keep them all in one place and sync them across devices)
-   More portable (mobile, desktop and print views)
-   Encourages correct and consistent script preparation practices

## What I Need From You

With these in mind, please take the time to fill out [this short survey](https://forms.gle/dCXGnUejTdfbxzWF7) after you've given the app a go. Feel free to ask my any questions on facebook or instagram.

Thanks!

**Arie**
