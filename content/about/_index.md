[View Resume](/resume)

I'm a software developer from Sydney, Australia. 

I'm most comfortable programming in Python and Golang, but I can write JavaScript and Java code too. 

I have a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Majoring in Telecommuncations Engineering (2019).

When I was a teenager I spent a significant amount of time playing and developing code for the video game Garry's Mod.
